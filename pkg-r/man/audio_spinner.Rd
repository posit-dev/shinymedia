\arguments{
\item{...}{Additional attributes for the spinner, to be added directly to the \verb{<audio-spinner>} element.}

\item{src}{The source URL or URI for the audio file. This should be used for remote resources
or data URIs. If provided, this takes precedence over \code{con}.}

\item{con}{An optional connection object or file path for local audio files. This is ignored
if \code{src} is provided. Use this for reading local files securely.}

\item{rpm}{The speed of the spinner, in clockwise revolutions per minute. Default is 10 RPM.
Use 0 to disable rotation, or a negative value to rotate counter-clockwise.}

\item{gap}{The gap between the blades of the spinner, in radians. Default is pi/5, or 36Â°.}

\item{stroke}{The stroke thickness of the individual arcs that make up each blade of the spinner,
in pixels. Default is 2.5.}

\item{min_radius}{The radius of the spinner when there is only silence, in pixels. Default is 30.}

\item{radius_compression}{The raw \verb{[-1, 1]} amplitude of the audio is compressed using
\code{x^radius_compression} to make the spinner more responsive to quiet sounds. Default is 0.8.
Set to 1.0 to disable compression. (Note that this only affects the visualization, not the audio playback.)}

\item{radius_overscan}{Use this parameter to set the maximum possible radius of the spinner,
relative to the width/height of the container. Default is 1.1, meaning the spinner radius
will be scaled such that at maximum amplitude, it will be 10\% larger than the container
(the spinner blades will be clipped). Use larger values if you're expecting generally quiet audio.}

\item{steps}{The number of concentric arcs that make up each blade of the spinner, not including
the central circle. Default is 2.}

\item{blades}{The number of blades in the spinner. Default is 3. Set to 0 to use concentric circles
instead of blades.}

\item{width}{The width of the spinner in CSS units. Default is "125px".}

\item{height}{The height of the spinner in CSS units. Default is "125px".}

\item{autoplay}{Whether to autoplay the audio. Default is TRUE. Note that many browsers will not
allow autoplaying audio without user interaction; if autoplay fails, the spinner will show a
tooltip instructing the user to tap or click to start the audio.}

\item{autodismiss}{Whether to remove the spinner after the audio finishes playing. Default is FALSE.}

\item{class}{The class of the spinner. Default is "mx-auto" which horizontally centers the element
inside its container (assuming Bootstrap is loaded).}
}
\value{
An HTML tag object representing the audio spinner.
